            <p>My name is Ben deLong, and I am a hardworking, dynamic individual who has strong interest in front-end development looking to bring experience, great attitude, and ideas to an innovative team as a junior front-end developer. I Always bring a critical mind while working on tasks, and I strive to make the working environment not only productive but also fun.</p>
            <p>I am currently working as an accounting analyst with a data science start-up company in downtown Chicago, and I have been working in the finance industry pretty much my whole adult-life</p>
            <p>However, unlike how many people were "born to" do a particular thing, I was never born for finance. As I progressed in my career, I continually found it unfulfilling and stressful.  So one fateful day in August 2017, I took the leap, quit my job, and started down the path to self-learning to become a professional web developer... that is until I started to run out of money. I ultimately had to get another finance job to pay the bills, but the spark for web development was still there.</p>
            <p>As I was contemplating my re-emergence into the web development world, I stumbled upon the coding class offered by Northwestern, and it was exactly what I needed. It provided structure, resources, but most of all, community.  And the fact that it offered a part-time option was great, because now I wouldn't have to blow through my savings as I continued to learn.</p>
            <p>By the end of this course I hope to have cultivated enough skills in oreder to seriously persue a career as a front-end web developer.  Though, even if I'm not quite employment ready, I still plan to continue refining my skills; working on independent projects with a good friend of mine.</p>
            <p>Thanks for visiting my page! Please check out my portfolio, and feel free to drop me some contact infoinformation if you'd like to get in touch.</p>
